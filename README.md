A simple CMS system.

## Introduction

Most CSM provide complicate template system for customization and impresss audiences. They are all great, but this
project would focuse on content and the creator especially the programmers. I want to help them to create and update
the content in the most efficent way.

## About Me

I am an Software Engineer in San Francisco. I got involued many project across different industry, including but not
limited to WordPress, Drupal, ECommerce Magento, Discuz Forum, Social Network, IoT, Huaman Robot and ect. The concept of
this project come from my prvious project in NLP (Natural Language Processing). For NPL, we need deal with the content
and the related domains.

## Purpose

So far we still don't have clear standard to define the domain. Each industry would have their own terminology, they
don't share well with each other. Eg. A "Modal", it could be 3D Modal, Data Modal or maybe Business Modal. I wish my
project can resolved the problem.

## Practice

There are few thing you can use this project to practice.

1. CMS, you can publish your content with this program.
2. ECommerce, you can also use this program to sale your product or service.
